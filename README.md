# Nuclear Fission Energy Calculation

This project calculates and visualizes the energy released in nuclear fission reactions.

## Features
- Uses Einsteinâ€™s equation to compute energy.
- Compares different isotopes (Uranium-235, Plutonium-239, etc.).
- Visualizes data using Matplotlib.
- Predicts energy for unknown isotopes using Machine Learning.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script: python fission_energy.py
   
## Future Work
- Extend project for fusion reactions.
- Implement real-time data analysis for nuclear power plants.
